- Hi data guys/girls! Im glad you guys are stopping by, since this project meant alot to me. As we all know covid has been a horrible time in our lives. Me and my family have been devistated by some covid deaths in our family and it was something i would never wish upon anyone. I decided to explore this dataset just to see how horrible covid really was, not just for me and my family, but for people all across the globe.
- Some of the finding in this data set are terrifying. Digging through this data helped me really empathize with everyone that went through similar situations as me. I feel that with all of the numbers being reported on the news, you can sometimes lose touch with reality and we can become desensitized to the information. However, when you look through this data and see how drastic the total cases increased day by day, it brings you back. I often found myself getting lost in the findings and spending hours on looking at the results on a single query.
- All of my insights are summed up into a dashboard on my Tableau profile that you can find in my bio. Again, I want to thank everyone for stopping by and for everone to remember that we are all in this together and we will all pull through this together as well. Love
